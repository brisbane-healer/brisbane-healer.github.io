## Cupping Therapy

Cupping is an ancient Chinese therapy where a therapist places cups onto the skin of a client to create suction. This suction effect helps to stimulate the proper flow of qi/prana throughout the body, facilitating blood flow and healing. Cupping is used to treat pain and inflammation, it may also relieve muscle tension, and can be used as a type of deep tissue massage. Cupping is believed to help the bodyâ€™s resistance to pathogens and encourage cell repair.

###### Cupping is not suitable for those that:

* Taking blood thinning medication
* If the person has skin ulcers, sunburnt, or flesh wound
* Have an internal organ disorder
* Children under 4 years old
* Seniors as the skin is more fragile as we age
* Pregnant people should avoid cupping the abdomen and lower back
* Women currently menstruating
