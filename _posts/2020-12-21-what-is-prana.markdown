Prana is a Sanskrit word meaning breath or life force. In China it is commonly referred to as qi or chi but has many names in different cultures.

Prana is the essence or soul of all things that animates everything on the planet. This essential life force energy flows through our bodies sustaining us physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually.

Without this integral life force energy, you would not be alive. All life as we know it would cease to exist. All things animate and inanimate are bathed in prana.
