## Hot Stone Massage

Hot stone massage is an incredibly relaxing and soothing form of massage therapy where smooth flat basalt stones are heated and positioned on certain areas of the body to promote healing and relaxation.

These basalt stones transfer heat to the body gradually, creating a deep and calm state of being. The heat from the stones deeply penetrates the muscles allowing them to relieve the body from aches, pain, stiffness and tension as well as improving joint flexibility.

Once the stones have been on the body for a certain amount of time, the practitioner will then use oil and the heated stones to massage the entire body. Hot stone massage can be used as an alternative treatment to deep tissue massage. When skilfully used by a practitioner, basalt stones are a very effective massage tool for treating deep tissue problems.

Hot stone massage strengthens the immune system and instantly reduces stress, anxiety and insomnia. Studies show that hot stone massage may even reduce the symptoms of cancer and auto immune disease.
