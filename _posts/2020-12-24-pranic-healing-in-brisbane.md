Pranic Healing presents a unique holistic approach used to treat a variety of ailments, from fever to heart conditions to cancer. By tapping into pranic or "ki" (chi) energy - the universal force which is our life force - the author presents techniques for beginning, intermediate and advanced healing.

#### Pranic healing influences your natural life force

Pranic healing is a no-touch modality where all types of illnesses can be treated. It is a highly developed and tested system of energy-based healing techniques, using “prana" – the vital energy life-force to balance, harmonise and transform your body's energy processes. The Chinese refer to this subtle energy as "Chi" in acupuncture. It is also called "Ruha" in Hebrew or the "Breath of Life" in the Old Testament.

Pranic healing influences your natural life force to bring about a healthier physical body and is applied on your bio-electromagnetic field known as the aura, which contains the mold and blueprint of your physical body. Your bioplasmic body absorbs life energy and distributes it to your organs and glands. Diseases first appear as energetic disruptions in your energy field before manifesting as ailments in your physical body.
