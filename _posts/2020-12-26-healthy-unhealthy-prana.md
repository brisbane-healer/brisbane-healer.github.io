The human energetic anatomy is a complex and sophisticated system made up of the aura, the chakras, the meridians and nadis. When a person’s energetic anatomy is balanced, unobstructed and in a state of natural flow, an individual will be pain free, content and happy. They will be vibrant and have good stamina, they will be productive and creative, their body will be healthy and be more magnetic, and they will sleep peacefully waking up energised.

Deficient or stagnant prana can manifest in many ways, such as having irregular body temperature or feeling lethargic, fatigued and weak. Sexual or menstrual problems can occur as well as digestive and bowel issues. It may compromise one’s immunity making them prone to colds, flues, diseases and allergies. Often people age prematurely or experience weight problems. Unbalanced prana may cause insomnia, procrastination and lack of motivation. Anger, fear, worry, mania, depression, paranoia or anxiety are just some of the ways irregular prana can affect us psychologically.

One of the most important skills a person can acquire is learning how to work with Prana for the maintenance of your physical, emotional, mental and spiritual wellbeing. This can be achieved through diet, meditation, and exercise. Practices such as pranic healing, Tai Chi and Yoga are extremely beneficial in cultivating a healthy Pranic flow throughout the body.
