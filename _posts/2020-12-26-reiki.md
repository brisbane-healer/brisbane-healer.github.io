## Reiki

Reiki is a Japanese form of energy healing. The English translation for Reiki is universal energy. It is a simple yet very therapeutic energetic healing modality.

The reiki practitioner channels universal energy to a patient by means of touch. Human touch helps heal a personâ€™s mind, body and spirit. 

Compassion and love can be felt through the touch of another and this feeling has tremendous transformative healing power.

Along with Reiki, Tui Na massage is another wonderful way to experience the powerful benefits of hands on healing.
